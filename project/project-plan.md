# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Effects of Surface Temperature Change on Climate-related Disasters.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How have different regions around the world been affected by changes in surface temperature in terms of climate-related disasters?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Different regions around the world have been affected by changes in surface temperature in various ways, leading to an increase in the frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters. This data science project aims to determine the effect of surface temperature on climate-related disasters.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Annual Surface Temperature Change
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/4063314923d74187be9596f10d034914_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset shows annual estimates of mean surface temperature change measured with respect to a baseline climatology, corresponding to the period 1961-2022.

### Datasource2: Climate-related Disasters Frequency
* Metadata URL: https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821/explore
* Data URL: https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/b13b69ee0dde43a99c811f592af4e821_0.csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset shows number of climate related natural disasters between 1980-2022.
